# Laravel 10 Notification  ðŸ”¥ ðŸš€

This is a **Laravel v10.x** api to *emulate* a notification system, manipulating the notifications data through defined endpoints. No real notifications are dispatched, the application is just for controlling the notifications history.

The project uses a *Dockerized* environment and was created for refinement of **Laravel** knowledge considering the newest version of the framework (at the time of his creation). It also work as a skills showcase.

| Docker | v20.10.x |
| Docker Compose | v3.8.x |
| Redis | v6.2.x |
| Mysql | v8.0.x |

- Use concepts of repository pattern
- Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to transport groups of data between the application layers
- Use Form-Request classes to validate input data
- Use resource classes to format the output data of endpoints
- Use customized pagination with one of the endpoints
- Implementing API endpoints documentation using the package **Scribe**
